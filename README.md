# CorDapp Extendability

This is an example of how to extend cordapps behaviour with respect to overriding Initiated and Initiating Flows. 
It is documented [here](https://docs.corda.net/head/flow-overriding.html)

To deploy the cordapp and it's associated nodes, run `./gradlew clean demo-builder:deployNodes`
